I'm Patrick Johannessen, a software developer based in Brisbane, Australia. I work with the amazing team at [SixPivot](https://sixpivot.com.au/). I enjoy coding, video games, reading, writing and dreaming.   

This site is hosted on [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Cocoa Enhanced](https://github.com/mtn/cocoa-eh-hugo-theme) theme. The name of the site is an homage to [The Lonesome Crowded West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lonesome_Crowded_West).
